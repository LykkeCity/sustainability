		<p>It may be unusual to find peace on the agenda of a fintech company -- but Lykke isn't about business as usual.</p>

    <p>The respected Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) estimates that last year the cost of violence on the global economy was USD14 trillion, or 12.6% of GGDP. The ROI of peacebuilding is 16 times the cost of intervention and, as inequality and absence of agency are drivers of conflict, we see ourselves as instrumental in helping to mitigate those risks. Corruption is one of the areas where a transparent, immutable, blockchain-based financial system for payments, aid and remittances can have significant impact.</p>

    <p>Mobilizing action around environmental protection through currencies like SolarCoin and TREE is another way we can play our part, as ecosystem degradation also contributes considerably to conflict. Free flow of information and a sound business environment have been shown to contribute to  positive peace according to IEP findings. At Lykke we are building community and fostering respect for the rights of others, opening dialogue that transcends borders and nationalities, gender and age. </p>

    <p>On a practical level we are driven by compassion for some of the horrors we see happening in our world. Our vision is to make it possible for everyone to own their financial identity and securely hold funds in any currency. A family fleeing war will, be able to take their assets with them in digital form, empowered to start life anew despite a devalued national currency.  
    The ability to trace the supply chains of arms, conflict minerals, and trafficked people, coupled with the tools to hold immutable ledgers on transactions, will enable us to more equitably share the wealth of nations, and may yet prove to be a surprise driver of peace in coming years.</p>
