      <p>Sustainability is an active choice requiring leadership and vision. Lykke's founders Richard Olsen, Sergey Ivliev and Anton Golub: "We see it as part of our DNA and want it embedded in our thinking across our business. When we hire we care not only that people have world class skills, but that they see themselves in service of their colleagues, our customers and the greater good".</p>

      <p>It is paradoxical that technology that seems so impersonal can be directed to making finance personal and inclusive and help lift people out of poverty. We've made opening a Lykke wallet 
      easy and secure, with a vision that eventually anyone with a smartphone, rich or poor, can own how their money is received, spent, invested, and protected without expensive intermediaries.</p>

      <p>The financial empowerment of women is a priority. Not only because they are the majority of the 1 billion+ unbanked, they also represent USD18 trillion in purchasing power. There is strong evidence of benefits cascading to children and society as a whole. Lykke is dedicated to improving gender balance in our own workforce and includes a stated commitment to family written into our employee agreements. </p>

      <p>More broadly, we agree with Pulitzer winner Gerzema that 'feminine values, present in women and men, are the operating system of the 21st century.' These being inclusion, compassion, humility and co-operation. "We know we can't change systems that are so interdependent without collaboration," says Inge Relph, Head of Sustainability. Sustainable Development Goal 17 on building global partnerships is the one we pivot around.</p>
