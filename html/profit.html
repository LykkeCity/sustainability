		<p>"We need to return to the financial system being for the common good," says Richard Olsen, the co-founder of Lykke.
    
    <p>Latterly the private sector has embraced the sustainability agenda in an unprecedented way; green bond issuance last year topped USD83 billion and impact investments are fast becoming the invisible heart of markets, harnessing capital, innovation and entrepreneurship to do good.</p>
   
    <p> However, it's not just <em>what</em> we finance but the financial system itself that needs to change. It has become a costly, exclusionary, and debt-laden behemoth with a serious trust deficit. Half of global wealth is in the hands of the richest 1%. Unaddressed, the fragility of the economic system remains the biggest threat to the social and environmental ecosystem. The last recession cost the USA alone upwards of USD13 trillion and put 46 million people into poverty. Currently 2 billion people, mostly the poor, remain unbanked and excluded from the formal economy. Paul Polman of Unilever has described unlocking this potential as 'an unprecedented opportunity agenda for the world to embrace'.</p>
    
    <p>We see ourselves as part of a movement to make finance inclusive. Our blockchain-enabled distributed ledger system allows for peer-to-peer transactions that are transparent, cost efficient and immediate. It is immutable and restores trust to the financial process without relinquishing profitability.</p>

    <p>As part of our commitment to realizing the SDGs, where blockchain offers fresh solutions, we are building partnerships to incentivise impact investment and the more efficient use of capital. eg. cheaper worldwide payments and remittances, microlending and insurance without expensive intermediaries.  Regulation is a pre-requisite for the markets to operate with integrity and see high adoption. Lykke has applied to be regulated in major centres and is contributing to the discussions on how to protect consumers yet not stifle innovation.</p>
    
    <p>Crowdsourcing ideas and building community are fundamental to democratising what we do, as is open-sourcing and sharing our research and algorithms. We sponsor prizes and encourage internships to spread our network of knowledge. At a deeper level we find we are constantly challenged to examine our motivation and test if it really is for the common good.  We try to hold true to this compass of purpose.</p>
