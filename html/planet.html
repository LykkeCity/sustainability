		<p>The financial world has too often been driven by price rather than value. As a sector it has been flawed in the treatment of nature, awakening late to the impacts and dependencies on natural and social capital in larger ecosystems and their importance to the global economy and society.</p>
		
		<p>Lykke has been a frontrunner in pricing and tokenizing externalities, both good and bad, testing our notions of value and making natural assets tradeable and accessible. We don't believe in reducing something as complex and interrelated as our environment to reductive economic values. Our company's home is nestled amongst the beauty of the Swiss Alps, and our staff are passionate about nature, motivated to protect her intrinsic value for our, and future generations. </p>
		
		<p>The first natural capital tokens to be listed on our exchange are SolarCoin and TREE. Both are digital currencies, tradeable and convertible commission free, and are proving to be incentives in favour of renewable energy, coastal conservation, and carbon mitigation. Solarcoin is an energy reward, with each token representing one megawatt-hour of verified solar production. Similarly, TREE is tied to mangrove forests, with each TREE representing one of 2.7 million (and counting) new mangrove trees planted, each sequestering 5x more carbon than a dry tree. Both of these will scale considerably in reach and impact.</p>
		
		<p>There are a number of other conservation listings in development. These tokens represent part of our core mission: to enable people to make a difference and invest in what is truly valuable.</p>
